# Throw away utilities

A collection of utility functions and classes that are too small to create a separate project for each one.

Rules:

1.  Nothing in this project should have external dependencies.
2.  Anything here can just as easily be copy-pasted instead of bringing in the dependency.

Requirements:

1.  JVM >= 1.7
2.  Scala >= 2.10.x
